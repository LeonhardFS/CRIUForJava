Tasks:

Demo programs:
   Elastic Search
   Serverless
      

Features:

   Java API:
      Check() => Verify that Checkpointing is enabled in your kernel and working properly.
                 Check to see if your current JVM has any issues (open sockets etc).

      Save() => Runs Hooks, Runs CRIU dump.

      SaveIncremental() => Saves just the changes since the last Save()/SaveIncremental().

      Restore() => Restores a saved Image using CRIU restore.

      AddCheckpointHook(Hook h) => run h  method at checkpoint.

      AddRestoreHook(Hook h)  => run h method at restore.


Tasks:

      Figure out if Hooks are interfaces or Lambdas.
      
      Implement System Hooks:

	        GC/shrink the heap and then reinflating it.
		Shutdown workstealing thread pools and re-establish with an appropriate number of threads based on number of available processors.

      Implement User example hooks:
		Clear certificates and then re-establish them
	        Clearing connections and then restoring them.		

      Hot Swapping Garbage Collection Algorithms just before checkpointing.  Warmup and rampup with ParallelGC, checkpoint/restore with epsilon. Give memory for card tables etc back before checkpoint.

      Optimize heap layout.  Use hardware monitors to determine false cache line sharing and pad data structures before checkpointing.

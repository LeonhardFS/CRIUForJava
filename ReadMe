This is demo code to show how to use CRIU (Checkpoint Restore In Userspace) from Java.

It's very much a prototype.  There are many caveats in this file.  Please try it and let me know how it goes.

Make sure criu is running from the directory that has the socket file.
[cflood@cflood FromInsideJava]$ sudo /home/cflood/criu/criu-latest/criu/criu service
Warn  (criu/cr-service.c:1160): Binding to local dir address!

Make sure kernel is compiled with CR turned on
sudo grep CHECKPOINT /boot/config-*

javac CheckpointRestore.java

javah CheckpointRestore

mv CheckpointRestore.h CheckpointRestore.hpp

Make sure criu is installed and libcriu is on your library path.  I set mine via
export LOAD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64:./
There is probably a better way

Build the criu library.
gcc -shared -fPIC  -I/usr/lib/jvm/java-openjdk/include -I/usr/lib/jvm/java-openjdk/include/linux -I/usr/lib64/  -I/usr/include/criu -lcriu -o libCheckpointRestore.so CheckpointRestore.cpp

There is currently a problem with a socket file which is causing tests to fail.  The short term fix is to delete this file.
I did rm -rf rm -f /var/lib/sss/pipes/nss
I'm working on addressing this problem.

You can now checkpoint java code:
sudo setsid java -XX:+UseSerialGC -XX:-UsePerfData -Djava.library.path=$LOAD_LIBRARY_PATH TestRandom 1000000 1000

This will print out the restore instructions which you can run as root:

sudo java -XX:+UseSerialGC -XX:-UsePerfData -Djava.library.path=$LOAD_LIBRARY_PATH  TestRandomRestore <saved world directory>
